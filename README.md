# Project GAIA

Project GAIA is a personal long-term project which his main purpose is to create an international AI system which analyzes images from satellites and geo-data, to create prediction about possible imminent natural disasters generated by the climate change. The system will send alerts, warnings and suggestions to non-governmental organizations concerned with the protection of the environment, governmental authorities and especially to local authorities just to get prepared to eliminate the threat or at least to minimize it.  

The main goal of the project is to reduce the loss of human lives due to global warming and and its effects (like famine, water shortages, social unrest etc.)
